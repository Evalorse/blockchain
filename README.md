Implementing a blockchain to track the validity of aeronautical pieces.

The project revolves around 3 computers each runnning server.c as well as (upcoming) client.c.
Simuating a peer-to-peer-ish network.

The computers (don't know which) will then execute a bloc mining program, creating a block and broadcasting it to the other
computers.
